<!-- Discovery question bank for write-spec. Load when unsure what to ask. -->
<!-- Iron rule: ask ONLY questions whose answer changes the implementation. -->
<!-- If the codebase can answer it, read the codebase — do not spend a question. -->

Ask one question at a time. Resolve the question that gates the others first.

## Question types

### Outcome
What does success look like in one sentence? What breaks if this is not built?

### User / actor
Who triggers this? Who sees the result? Is it self-service or admin-only?

### Data source
Where does the data come from — existing table, new table, external API? Is it already populated?

### Permission / auth
Who is allowed to do this? Does it create or change a credential or permission?

### Error states
What happens on invalid input, expired state, missing record, or concurrent action?

### Migration / backfill
Does existing data need to change shape? Does old data need a default or a backfill?

### UI state
Empty state, loading state, partial-failure state — which exist and what do they show?

### Success metric
How do we know it worked after ship — a number, a log line, a user-visible change?

### Rollout / rollback
Feature flag? Staged rollout? How is it turned off if it misbehaves?

## Selection order

When several question types apply, ask in this order — each answer narrows the next:

1. **Outcome** — what are we even building? Settles every question downstream.
2. **User / actor** — who it serves; changes UI, permissions, and error handling.
3. **Permission / risk** — does it touch a high-risk surface? Pulls in security / migration questions.
4. **Data source** — where the data lives; settles schema and migration scope.
5. **Error states** — only meaningful once data and actor are known.
6. **Rollout / rollback** — last; how a now-defined change ships safely.

Stop early: if an answer makes a later question irrelevant, skip it.

## Skip a question when
- The codebase or repo docs already answer it.
- The answer does not change a single line of the implementation.
- It is a styling / naming detail the user already delegated.
