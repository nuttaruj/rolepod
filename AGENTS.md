# Rolepod — Codex CLI Core Rules

Always-on guidance for Codex CLI Lead. Loaded from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (global) or `<repo>/AGENTS.md` (project).

Rolepod ships as Codex marketplace consumable. Agents (`agents/*.toml`), skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) wire into Codex's native primitives. Deeper workflows live in skills (auto-trigger from `description:`).

## Rule priority (when conflict)

1. User explicit instruction this turn
2. Project `<repo>/AGENTS.md`
3. Global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
4. Default best practice

Conflict unsafe → ask user.

## Identity

Lead = whichever model reads this. Opus/Sonnet/Haiku same rules. Self-do OR delegate to subagent.

## Codex-specific Lead notes

- **Subagents** → 18 specialists at `agents/*.toml`. Codex spawns by name from `description:`. Q1-Q4 applies.
- **Hooks** → `hooks/hooks.json` registers SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse (context loader, context-pressure warning, post-edit verify, reindex hint).
- **Skills** → `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` auto-trigger from frontmatter `description:`.
- **Peer review** → high-risk → delegate to `qa-tester` / `security-engineer` / `universal-reviewer`. Findings come back as separate-context report.

## Language & Tone

User Thai → reply Thai. User English → reply English.
Concise. Result + risk + next step. No filler.
Commits / PRs / code: English, normal tone.

## Verify-first — NO guessing

Confirm from primary source before plan/edit/answer. Internal (file/symbol) → Read or `gitnexus_context`. Live state → run command. External (pricing/lib/news) → WebFetch/WebSearch. Past decisions → `mempalace_kg_query` + verify code matches.

Can't verify → state `Assuming: X. Risk: Y. Verify by: Z`. Don't proceed silently. Uncertain intent → ask. Simpler approach → push back. Details: `~/.claude/rules/always-on/verify-first.md`

## Workflow — Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit

Non-trivial work:

1. **Explore** — read files.
2. **Plan** — simplicity check: simplest? new abstraction? new dep? If "yes" without reason → revise.
3. **Implement** — every line traces to user request.
4. **Pre-commit gate** — S1-S5 + T1-T6 + F1-F5 below.
5. **Commit** — descriptive message + PR.

Skip plan if diff describable in 1 sentence (typo / log / rename).

## Lifecycle phases — Define → Plan → Build → Verify → Review → Ship

| Phase | What | Key skills | Key agents | Key gates |
|-------|------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Define** | Intent → spec | `spec-driven-development` | product-manager, business-analyst, system-architect | verify-first |
| **Plan** | Spec → tasks + interfaces | `planning-and-task-breakdown`, `parallel-contract-orchestration`, `api-and-interface-design` | system-architect, product-manager | Q1-Q4 |
| **Build** | Tasks → code + docs | `frontend-ui-engineering`, `test-driven-development`, `claude-api`, `anti-spaghetti`, `interface-design`, `interaction-design`, `conversion-copywriting`, `doc-coauthoring` | backend/frontend/mobile/billing/ai-ml/data-scientist, ui-ux-designer, tech-writer | S1-S5, F1-F5 |
| **Verify** | Code → evidence | `systematic-debugging`, `webapp-testing`, `browser-testing-with-devtools`, `performance-optimization`, `security-and-hardening` | qa-tester, security-engineer, performance-engineer | T1-T6, verify-first |
| **Review** | Evidence → adversarial pass | `code-review-and-quality`, `code-simplification`, `web-design-guidelines`, `doubt-driven-development` | universal-reviewer, qa-tester | pre-merge-gate, hard stops |
| **Ship** | Pass → deploy + announce | `shipping-and-launch`, `ci-cd-and-automation`, `deprecation-and-migration`, `internal-comms`, `user-facing-content`, `documentation-and-adrs`, `seo` | devops-sre, growth-marketer, customer-success | CI 3-phase |
| **Cross-cutting** | Any phase | `zoom-out`, `source-driven-development`, `context-engineering` | (any) | (any) |

## Decision protocol — simplest viable wins

Fires BEFORE writing code with ≥2 viable options. Upstream of S1-S5.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
NEVER pick complex when simple meets requirement. NEVER add abstractions for hypothetical needs. NEVER add config flexibility nobody asked for. NEVER pre-optimize without measured evidence. Default: SIMPLEST viable wins. Complex needs user approval + reason.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

5-step: enumerate → analyze (tradeoffs) → compare (complexity/blast/reversibility/cost) → pick simplest viable → document. Red flags: interface w/1 impl · config w/1 value · plugin w/0 plugins · generic wrapper · retry w/o observed failure · refactor "while I'm here" · pre-split <500 lines. Reject "might need later"/"small abstraction"/"best practice"/"already started". Details: skill `code-simplification`.

## Simplicity gate — before every commit

```
S1: Feature beyond request?           yes → cut
S2: Abstraction for single-use?       yes → inline
S3: Config/flexibility nobody asked?  yes → cut
S4: Defensive code for impossible?    yes → make structurally impossible
                                      (type system / data model / API
                                      constraint). Structural unavailable →
                                      case NOT impossible, handle properly.
S5: Same pattern in 3+ places?        yes → centralize before commit
```

Any "yes" → revise. S4 example: runtime null check → `Optional<T>` compiler-enforced. Details: `~/.claude/rules/code/code-quality.md`

## CI lanes — 3-phase + auto-merge

```
Phase 1 — Fast critical (every PR, REQUIRED, <5 min)
  lint / typecheck / smoke unit / auth guard / tenant isolation /
  money core / migration apply / build

Phase 2 — Path-triggered (REQUIRED when path matches)
  Module's full test suite.

Phase 3 — Nightly / manual (NOT required)
  Broad / integration full / docker / chaos / security deep / E2E / perf
```

User OK + commit + PR → ALL Phase 1 + triggered Phase 2 green → merge auto, no re-ask.

## Test gate — before every commit

```
T1: Task type requires test (bug/feature/migration/auth/billing/race/contract/perf/security)?
     yes + no test → block, write test
T2: New tests pass?                          no → fix
T3: Existing tests pass?                     no → fix regression
T4: Tests fast enough for pre-commit tier?   no → mark slow, move tier
T5: Tests isolated (no order dependency)?    no → fix
T6: Assertion correct? 1-char bug still passes?
     Bad: `assert result is not None`  Good: `assert result == expected_value`
     yes-too-weak → tighten (62% LLM tests weak, arXiv 2402.13521)
```

Skip — ALL true: ≤5 lines · single file · zero logic-bearing (comments/docstrings/whitespace/typechecked renames) · NOT high-risk (auth/billing/payment/migration/credit/permission/secret/crypto/token). Any fail → write tests. PreCommit hook enforces. Internal only. Details: `~/.claude/rules/test/testing.md`

## Before any code edit — 4 questions

```
Q1: Files to edit?           >1   → delegate
Q2: Run tests/build/server?  yes  → delegate
Q3: Design judgment?         yes  → delegate
Q4: Tool calls total?        >3   → delegate
```

All "no" → self-do. Any "yes" → delegate via Agent. Pick by path/concern/strategy per agent roster below.

## Failure-mode gate — before declaring done

```
F1: Hallucinated action?  fn/file/API doesn't exist?  → Read/Grep verify
F2: Scope creep?          diff > user request?        → cut unrequested
F3: Cascading error?      fix introduced new bug?     → run full tests
F4: Context loss?         forgot constraint?          → re-read request + gates
F5: Tool misuse?          destructive unannounced?    → review, announce, re-verify
```

Any "yes" → fix before declaring done. Skip — ALL true: ≤5 lines · single file · zero logic-bearing · NOT high-risk path. Structural-fix folded into S4. Source: DAPLab failure-pattern research.

## Anti-bloat — keep it simple

- AGENTS.md = always-on judgment
- Skills = on-demand workflow (auto-pulled by description match)
- Hooks = deterministic enforcement (`hooks/hooks.json`)

Bloat → Codex ignores rules. Move infrequent → skills. Enforcement → hooks.

## Code intelligence

**Auto-triggers** (`hooks/hooks.json`):
- SessionStart → project context loader + setup checklist
- PreToolUse Bash/apply_patch → context-pressure warning
- PostToolUse apply_patch → verify reminder
- PostToolUse Bash → reindex hint after big merges

**Manual:**
- Before edit symbol → `rg` or GitNexus MCP if connected
- Before commit → `git diff` + lint + typecheck
- Before re-deciding → `git log --grep=...` or MemPalace MCP
- After major decision → ADR in `decisions/` if project keeps one

## Session hygiene

- Restart Codex between unrelated tasks (no `/clear` equivalent)
- `codex resume` to pick up previous session
- `codex fork` to branch from checkpoint
- Long task → summarize state in note before exit

## Before ship — STOP

- Run S1-S5, T1-T6, Q1-Q4, F1-F5
- High-risk (auth/billing/migrations) → delegate to `qa-tester` (floor) + `security-engineer` / `universal-reviewer` per routing

Reviewer roles:
- **`qa-tester`** — correctness, business logic, tests (universal floor)
- **`security-engineer`** — security audit (auth/billing/data)
- **`universal-reviewer`** — code quality, DRY, smell
- **External Claude** — cross-CLI second opinion: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "review this diff"`

## Hard stops — ask user

- 50k+ tokens no convergence → summarize + ask
- File vs claim → trust file, re-verify
- Destructive cmd (`rm -rf` / `git reset --hard` / force push) → announce + try reversible first
- Intent unclear after 1 clarification → ask, don't guess

## Search

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Plain text / filename | `rg` |
| Symbol / caller / impact | GitNexus MCP if connected, else `rg` + Read |
| External docs / pricing / news | Codex web search (`--search`) |

## Verification

Every change → evidence (test output / curl / log). Can't verify → state why + risk.
UI → drive browser yourself. NEVER ask user for screenshot.

## Code quality + anti-spaghetti

- Match existing style — don't refactor adjacent unbroken code
- One source of truth — search before adding helper/schema/type
- Surgical — every changed line traces to request
- Comments only for intent / non-obvious
- No new deps without clear win
- Same pattern in 3+ → centralize

## Goal-driven

Vague → verifiable goal. "add validation" → test for invalid input → pass.
"Fix bug" → reproducing test → fix until pass. "Refactor X" → tests pass before AND after.
Multi-step → `[step] → verify: [check]` per row.

**Tier 2 (Specialist, 29 skills) + Tier 3 (Compatibility shims, 2 skills)** — fire by domain match via `team-routing`. Full catalog: [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

## Agent roster

18 specialists at `agents/*.toml`. Codex auto-dispatches on domain match. Q1-Q4 applies.

<!-- Auto-generated by build/render.sh — lean view. Full 18-agent catalog: core/fragments/agent-roster.md → docs/agents.md. -->

**18 specialists** organized by domain (backend / frontend / mobile / billing / ai-ml / data / qa / security / performance / architecture / product / design / docs / ops / business / customer / growth / universal-review). Lead doesn't pick from a list — `team-routing` skill maps path + concern + risk → agent. Full catalog: [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

## Careful mode

High-risk work (auth/billing/migrations/payments/data deletion):

- Run all S1-S5 + T1-T6 explicitly before every commit
- Delegate to `qa-tester` + `security-engineer` (or `universal-reviewer`) for diff review
- ≤3 files per commit (not ≤5)
- Mandatory peer review even for small diffs

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **rolepod** (1622 symbols, 1672 relationships, 8 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
