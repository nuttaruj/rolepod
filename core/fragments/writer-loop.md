## Writer loop

For task owners — skip the whole block when the brief is report-only.

- **Completion check** — Grep/Read each file you claim you changed; run
  test / lint / typecheck; confirm no silent failure (a DB column needs its
  migration, an API field needs schema + response). Never report COMPLETED
  with a failing or unrun check; no shell tool → name each check for the
  Lead to run (`RUN NEEDED: <command>`) and never mark it passed.
- **Autonomous errors** — never blind-edit; on a failing command analyze,
  retry at most twice, then escalate.
- **Ticket loop** — Writers: build test-first at the brief's seam; after each edit run only the checks covering the file just edited (its case section on a slow file); the brief's full Command runs ONCE, last before returning, then the repo commit check once — never per fix round. Stay inside the brief's Files and Change: no side harness a case can hold, no fix beyond a finding; a residual goes into the brief.
  - A logic slice → call the `tdd-flow` skill; no Skill tool → test-first at the brief's seam: one behavior, one failing test, the smallest code that passes, then the next behavior.
  - Scratch output (a captured run, a count) → a `mktemp` file or `.rolepod/evidence/`, never a path typed outside the repo: a write there can wait on a permission prompt a background owner never sees.
  - Reviewer dispatch — the first match wins; every reviewer gets the diff as a file, `git add -A && git diff --cached > .rolepod/evidence/review/<task>.diff` (staged, so new files count; the tree stays staged for the Lead), because a reviewer has no shell; no shell to write it → `REVIEW NEEDED:` instead of a dispatch:
    - a `check-work` Verify run → no reviewer;
    - a high-risk path, or a Tier line naming R4 → `universal-reviewer` (read-only, two axes; or the concern-matched row; the external CLI instead when the brief's Reviewers line names one) plus `security-engineer` on a high-risk path, in ONE message; each writes its report to `.rolepod/evidence/review/<task>-<role>.md`; a detached external running → fix the internal findings first, then collect it;
    - Reviewers `none` (an R2/R3 task in a plan) → no reviewer; the Lead reviews the plan once before release;
    - a Reviewers line naming roles → those roles, in ONE message; each writes `.rolepod/evidence/review/<task>-<role>.md`;
    - any other brief (a standalone R2 checklist, a debug hand-off) → the two lenses yourself (`universal-reviewer` with `lens: spec` and `lens: standards`), in ONE message; each lens writes `.rolepod/evidence/review/<task>-<lens>.md`.
  - Fix the findings, re-run the checks covering the fix.
  - Round 2 only for a BLOCKER / MAJOR fix, internal and non-adversarial: the reviewer who flagged it re-checks that finding on the delta (a read-only reviewer re-traces; one with a shell re-runs its repro); an external's finding goes to `security-engineer` on a high-risk path, else to strong `universal-reviewer` — never a new external round; a new issue it finds is a normal finding to fix.
  - Return: a plan task returns the **decision brief** — diff stat, Command tail, reviewer verdicts + report paths, `Assuming:` lines, residuals; any other brief returns the shape your Return section names, with the reviewer verdicts + report paths appended. A reviewer is due and you have no dispatch tool → add `REVIEW NEEDED: <what to check>` — the Lead runs the review after you return. Cannot self-approve; never commit.
