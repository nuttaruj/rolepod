# Using Rolepod — workflow router

Rolepod routes every task through one workflow spine:

```
Define → Plan → Build → Verify → Review → Ship
```

Lead reads this skill on the first turn of each request. Pick the phase, fire the required skill, then resume normal work inside that phase. Specialists (frontend / backend / billing / security / etc.) are chosen **after** the phase is clear, not before.

## Iron Rule

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
Before plan / edit / recommendation / answer → identify task type + required phase + required skill.

User explicit instruction wins. If user says "skip spec", "answer only", "just write the code" → obey, state which gate was skipped, proceed.

Default: route through the spine. Skipping is allowed only when (a) the task is trivial-answer-only, (b) user explicitly authorizes the skip, OR (c) the request is a question with no action attached.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Quick router

Match the user intent to the FIRST skill that fires. The skill itself decides what comes next. The **Model tier** column hints which agent tier is appropriate when the work delegates — see `core/fragments/model-tier-policy.md` for the full policy.

| User intent (verbs / phrases) | Phase | First skill fires | Model tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| "build / add / create / make / design" + vague target | **Define** | `spec-driven-development` | cheap (PM/spec) |
| "build X to spec" + spec exists | **Plan** | `planning-and-task-breakdown` | cheap–balanced |
| "execute plan / work the plan / implement plan.md" | **Plan→Build** | `planning-and-task-breakdown` → `subagent-task-execution` | balanced |
| "fix bug / failing test / broken / regression / why does X fail" | **Build (bug)** | `systematic-debugging` → `test-driven-development` | balanced |
| "refactor / simplify / clean up" | **Build (refactor)** | `code-simplification` → `post-change-verify` | balanced |
| "use agents / multi-agent / in parallel / parallel-safe" | **Plan** | `team-routing` → `parallel-contract-orchestration` | balanced |
| UI / browser / frontend / dashboard work | **Build (UI)** | `frontend-ui-engineering` → `webapp-testing` | balanced |
| **security / auth / billing / token / payment / migration** | **Build (high-risk)** | `security-and-hardening` → `test-driven-development` → `code-review-and-quality` | **strong** |
| architecture decision (DB schema / API contract / module split) | **Plan** | `api-and-interface-design` → `system-architect` agent | **strong** |
| "is this done / fixed / does it work / verify" | **Verify** | `post-change-verify` | balanced |
| "review / check this / look at the diff" | **Review** | `code-review-and-quality` (route via `reviewer-flow` for high-risk) | **adversarial** |
| "ship / merge / push / PR / ready / go live" | **Ship** | `pre-merge-gate` | **adversarial** (final review) |
| "document / explain the choice / write ADR / runbook" | (cross-cut) | `documentation-and-adrs` | cheap |

If no row matches: ask the user what phase the task is in. Don't pattern-match yourself into Build.

### Model tier hint reading

- **cheap** = haiku-class. Docs, PM, business analysis, customer-facing copy.
- **balanced** = sonnet-class (default). Normal implementation.
- **strong** = opus-class. Architecture, billing, security, migration code.
- **adversarial** = opus-class reviewer. Final-pass code review; security review of high-risk paths.

Agent frontmatter sets the model. Lead doesn't override unless user explicitly asks.

## State machine — phase → exit evidence → next

Router fires the **first** skill per phase. Phase exits only when its **exit evidence** is on the table (or user explicitly authorizes skip). Next phase reads from the **Next allowed** column — no jumping.

| Phase | Required first skill | Exit evidence | Next allowed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Define** | `spec-driven-development` | written spec OR approved one-line design (≤5-line task) OR explicit "skip spec" | Plan |
| **Plan** | `planning-and-task-breakdown` (+ `team-routing` + `parallel-contract-orchestration` if multi-agent) | ordered task list with done-condition + verify command per task; dependencies marked | Build |
| **Build** | `test-driven-development` (+ `subagent-task-execution` if delegated) (+ `systematic-debugging` for bug intent) | changed files + tests added (or explicit no-test justification) + red→green evidence | Verify |
| **Verify** | `post-change-verify` | fresh command output / screenshot / curl / log evidence; OR explicit "verify impossible because X" risk note | Review (high-risk / multi-file) OR Ship (low-risk) |
| **Review** | `code-review-and-quality` (+ `reviewer-flow` for high-risk routing → Codex / Gemini / security-engineer) | findings fixed OR rejected with line-anchored reason; no unresolved blocker | Ship |
| **Ship** | `pre-merge-gate` then `finishing-a-development-branch` | S+T+F gates green; required CI lanes pass; user approval when policy requires; 4-option finish menu presented (merge / open PR / keep / discard) | **end** |

**Router decides the first move only.** Each downstream skill owns its own gates; using-rolepod doesn't re-explain them.

## Skip rule

Skip a phase WHEN ALL true (state explicitly in response):

- task is pure question / explanation / lookup (no file change)
- OR diff ≤5 lines + 1 file + 0 logic-bearing lines + not on high-risk path
- OR user explicit: "skip spec" / "just commit" / "answer only" / "no plan" / "ship as-is"

**Verify never fully skips** — `verify-first` is always-on. Trivial fixes drop the heavyweight verify (full suite, browser drive), not the lightweight one (re-read file, confirm edit landed).

## Stop conditions

- Coding before Define on ambiguous request → STOP, run `spec-driven-development`.
- Claiming done before Verify → STOP, run `post-change-verify`.
- 2nd parallel agent spawn without contract → STOP, run `parallel-contract-orchestration` (hook will block anyway).
- Sub-agent attempting `git commit` / `git push` / `gh pr merge` → blocked by `block-subagent-commit.sh`; Lead commits after reviewer pass.
- High-risk path (auth/billing/migrations/crypto/payments) with 0 reviewer agents dispatched → STOP, dispatch qa-tester + (Codex / Gemini / security-engineer if available).
- 3rd agent on same issue OR 3rd PR on same surface in one session → STOP, ask user (hard-stop rule).

## Finish ritual (Ship phase exit)

When the user says "done" / "finished" / "complete" / "ready" — or when the task obviously reached a natural stopping point — fire **in order**:

1. `post-change-verify` — produce concrete evidence the change works (test output / screenshot / curl).
2. `code-review-and-quality` — if multi-file or high-risk, route via `reviewer-flow` to pick adversarial reviewers (Codex / Gemini / qa-tester) per their domain match.
3. `finishing-a-development-branch` — present the 4-option decision menu so the user picks the next step explicitly:
   - **merge** to main
   - **open PR** (current branch)
   - **keep branch** open (still iterating)
   - **discard** (work was exploratory)

Never auto-pick. The branch decision is the user's, not Lead's.

## Output pattern

```
Routing: <phase> → <skill>
Reason: <one sentence>
Skipping: <phases + why>, or "none"
Next step: <concrete action>
```

Example — vague feature:
```
Routing: Define → spec-driven-development
Reason: "build a React todo list" = vague target, no spec.
Skipping: none.
Next step: 4-question interview to pin acceptance criteria.
```

Example — typo fix:
```
Routing: Build → direct edit (gate-light)
Reason: typo, ≤5 lines, 1 file, 0 logic, not high-risk.
Skipping: Define + Plan + heavyweight Verify. Lightweight Verify runs.
Next step: edit + re-read + commit.
```

Example — done claim:
```
Routing: Ship → finish ritual
Reason: user said "is this done?"
Skipping: none — runs post-change-verify → code-review-and-quality → finishing-a-development-branch.
Next step: run tests, paste pass output, present 4-option menu.
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Simple task, skip the spine" | Trivial-answer-only skips are explicit. Coding 5+ lines = run the spine. |
| "I already know what to build" | Even right answers without a spec drift mid-implementation. Write the 5-line spec; 30 seconds. |
| "User just wants a fix" | They want a *correct* fix. systematic-debugging finds the root; symptom patches recur. |
| "Tests are obvious, I'll add later" | Later never comes. TDD adds the test now or admits in writing it won't have one. |
| "Solo work, no contract needed" | The moment a second agent (or future-you in a fresh session) touches the surface, contract pays off. |
| "Reviewer takes too long" | Skip review = ship bugs. Codex/Gemini take ~30s for adversarial pass. |

## Don't

- Spawn specialist agents (frontend / backend / billing / etc.) before the phase is clear.
- Use `pre-merge-gate` as a placeholder ("I'll add it later"). It's the last skill, fires only at Ship.
- Replace `post-change-verify` with the agent's confidence ("looks right to me").
- Skip Define just because the user typed in a hurry. Ask 1-2 questions.
- Treat this skill as documentation. It's a router — pick a row, fire the skill.

## Influence

Sharpens the workflow spine that already exists in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md so that small models route the same way large ones do. Pairs with `team-routing` (specialist selection inside Build) and `pre-merge-gate` (final gate at Ship).
